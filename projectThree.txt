    
This project assumes you have downloaded a version of Visual Studio for Windows or Mac and, 
you are able to create the file ending in '.sln' and successfully open your project in Visual Studio. 
Follow the instructions below to create a project practicing .NET Frameworks with Visual Studio.
The example can be found, titled projectThree.zip, in the serverSideTech_Web repository.

1.
Create a new console application, with Visual Studio.
Create a text file that will have a list of at least 10 names of people.
This file can be a '.txt' file and it should be placed inside the Debug folder of your new console application.

2.
Create a simple program to access this file using streams. 
First add your name to the end of this file in a new line.
Present in the console (Command Line if running in Windows or Terminal if running in Mac)
all the names of the file and at the end of it, in a new line, a text that would say "There are X new participants
in the seminar" where X will be the number of lines (number of names) you read from the '.txt' file after adding 
your name to it. The final output generate should look something as below:

FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
FirstName LastName
YourFirstName YourLastName
There are 11 new participants in the seminar

Note: 
The first 10 names should already be included in the '.txt' file.
Your name will be included via the program and the final message 
that shows the X with the value of 11 new participants in the seminar.

Note:
The root of the application is the console application folder.
The '.txt' file contains at least 10 names.
The program was written using streams.
The names are shown in the console, including the new name added to the file.
The last message is showing with the right number of names in the '.txt' file.
