This project assumes you have downloaded a version of Visual Studio for Windows or Mac and, 
you are able to create the file ending in '.csproj' and successfully open your project in Visual Studio. 
Follow the instructions below to create a project practicing .NET Frameworks with Visual Studio.
The example can be found, titled projectFive.zip, in the serverSideTech_Web repository.

1.
Create a new console application using .NET Core via Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac). 
This application should show a message on the console to request the user to type his/her name.
Read the system date/time - as this is not to test your C# skills, here is the code you would use to have 
the current date/time in string format - DateTime.Now.ToString().

2.
Test the date/time string you got and depending on the time, you should present the final message to the user
as "XYZ, user! It is now dt-time" where XYZ will be "Good morning" or "Good afternoon" depending on the time
you read from the system. The user will be the name the user typed on the console and dt-time will be the 
current date/time you read from the system.

3.
Go to the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) and go to the application folder.
Type dotnet run. 
Results should be similar to the following:

***********************************************************************************
C:\Users\ERICA\Desktop\helloworld>cd projectFive
C:\Users\ERICA\Desktop\helloworld\projectFive>dotnet run
Type your name below:
Erica 
Good afternoon, Erica! It is now 1/1/2019 1:11:01 PM

C:\Users\ERICA\Desktop\helloworld\projectFive>
***********************************************************************************

Note:
You should see the message "Type your name below:" that the application produced.
Type "Your Name" and as soon as ENTER (RETURN) key is pressed the final message of 
the application is shown. The application should finish right after the last message 
is presented without expecting the user to hit any other key.

Note:
The final message should show "Good morning" or "Good afternoon" depending on the time of
the system where the application is running.
